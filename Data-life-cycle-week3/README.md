# Data life cycle

The life cycle of data is the plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy

Phases:

1. Planning: During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.

2. Capture: This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization

3. Manage: how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly

4. Analyze: This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals

5. Archive: Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again

6. Destroy: Destroy stored data and all shared copies
