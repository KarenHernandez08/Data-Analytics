# Problems

Understanding what kind of problem you're trying to solve and that's what we're going to talk about now

Six problems types:

- Making predictions: Using data to make an informed decision about how things maybe in the future

- Categorizing things: Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features

- Spotting something unusual: Identifying data that is different from the norm

- Identifying themes: Grouping categorized information into broader concepts

- Discovering connections: Findinf similar challengues faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them

- Finding patterns: Using hsitorical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again

## SMART Questions

Relevant questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.

Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied

Fairness: Ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias
